# Unemployment in Inida (Data-Prediction)
I worked on a data prediction project. The prediciton is done on Unemployment rate in India.
The dataset was taken from Kaggle.com as a csv file.
The csv filed was later edited and few unwanted columns like region,sex were removed.
In the file UR stands for Unemployment Rate and EE stands for Estimated Employment rate.
Just the basic data prediction is done.
Use this file to refer with the codes used.
